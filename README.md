TalkBox
=======

The goal of the TalkBox project is to develop an open-source, open-hardware Speech Generating Device (aka "SGD"). The project has been undertaken by faculty and students from the GaMaY Lab, in the Lassonde School of Engineering at York University, in collaboration with community partners.

Please see [here](http://tkunic.github.io/TalkBox) for setup instructions and details.

# Notice

The mpr121.py is derived from Scott Garner's [Beetbox](http://scott.j38.net/interactive/beetbox/) project, which is in turn based on [an Arduino example by Jim Lindblom](http://bildr.org/2011/05/mpr121_arduino/).
