{"name":"Talkbox","tagline":"An assistive technology framework based on the MPR121 capacitive touch sensor and Raspberry Pi.","body":"TalkBox\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThe goal of the TalkBox project is to develop an open-source, open-hardware Speech Generating Device (aka \"SGD\"). The project has been undertaken by faculty and students from the GaMaY Lab, in the Lassonde School of Engineering at York University, in collaboration with community partners.\r\n\r\nPlease find more information about our objectives at the [project website](http://talkbox.eecs.yorku.ca/?page_id=4804).\r\n\r\nThe current iteration of the TalkBox is mostly used as a teaching aid for students with with cognitive, physical or developmental disabilities. It serves as a configurable, cheap and portable soundboard, and can help with learning the essentials of verbal communication.\r\n\r\n## Setup\r\n\r\n### Hardware\r\n\r\nThe hardware necessary to make a TalkBox should cost you around $50. The following parts are necessary:\r\n\r\n- [MPR121 Capacitive Touch Sensor Breakout Board](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9695)\r\n- [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/)\r\n- A USB outlet or battery pack to power the device\r\n- Some headers and wires\r\n\r\n> FIXME add picture of a finished TalkBox\r\n\r\nA MPR121 capacitive touch sensor board is used to create easy to operate buttons that require only touch but no pressure. The schematic can be found [here FIXME](github.com/tkunic/TalkBox/schematic). Each of the pins labelled 0-11 can be connected to a conductive pad (like a piece of aluminium foil) to create a button. The rest of the assembly process consists of plugging in 5 wires from the MPR121 to the Raspberry Pi. The design has been kept simple to facilitate activities where the students could participate in the assembly of their own devices.\r\n\r\nSome tips when assembling the device:\r\n\r\n- The shorter the wires and the smaller the button pads the more reliably the device will fire. Please see above image for conventional setup.\r\n- Be careful with battery packs, when they are almost out of charge the device may become unstable (garbled sound output, brownouts etc.). Try finding a battery pack capable of supplying at least 1 A of current, but unless you need portability, using wall power is recommended.\r\n- In case of no audio, try running `sudo raspi-config` from the terminal and under Advanced Options force audio to 3.5mm. In case the volume is too low, use the `alsamixer` command and arrow keys to increase volume.\r\n\r\n### Software\r\n\r\nYou will need to install the TalkBox software onto a Raspberry Pi. Please begin by downloading the archive from one of the links in the sidebar to the Pi. Unpack the archive into your home directory (`/home/pi/`).\r\n\r\nNext, install the dependencies for TalkBox by running the following commands from a terminal (internet connection required):\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\nsudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get upgrade; sudo apt-get dist-upgrade\r\nsudo apt-get install python-smbus i2c-tools python-dev python-pip\r\nsudo pip install evdev\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, open /etc/modules (via `nano /etc/modules`) and add:\r\n```\r\ni2c-bcm2708\r\ni2c-dev\r\n```\r\n\r\nNext, open /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf (via `nano /etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf`) and comment out the following line by prepending `#` to it:\r\n\r\n`# blacklist i2c-bcm2708`\r\n\r\nand reboot.\r\n\r\nAfter connecting the MPR121 sensor, test if it is visible by running:\r\n\r\n`sudo i2cdetect -y 1`\r\n\r\n> FIXME You should see a field of zeros and a nonzero value\r\n\r\n## Use\r\n\r\nTo use TalkBox, run talkbox.py by double clicking it. A user interface should show up as below:\r\n\r\n![TalkBox GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tkunic/TalkBox/feature_gui/docs/TalkBoxWindowMockup.png)\r\n\r\n> FIXME add annotated screenshot of GUI instead of mockup\r\n\r\n> FIXME explain daemon mode (headerless)\r\n\r\n# Contributing\r\n\r\nWe welcome all contributions and improvements by the community!
